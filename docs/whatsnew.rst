Whatâ€™s New in Boundless Exchange
=========================================

Welcome to the latest update of Boundless Exchange! This release includes improved projection handling for ESRI remote services, as well as the added capability of MapBox basemap configuration via Exchange settings.

Users can now dynamically define form constraints and default options/values that can be used to collect information associated with a feature. This means feature attributes can be uploaded, as well as modified or re-ordered. Visibility for the attribute can be turned off or on.
